## Parity [v1.5.0: "Nativity"](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/releases/tag/v1.5.0) (2017-01-19)

Major feature release including _Tendermint_ consensus engine, _Multisig wallet_ support, _badge/certification_ UI integration and _automatic updates_.

Directories:

- New XDG-informed Parity data directory structure. Base dir (`--base-path` or `-d`) that defaulted to `$HOME/.parity` is changed to:
  - `/Users/You/AppData/Roaming/Parity/Ethereum` on Windows
  - `/Users/you/Library/Application Support/io.parity.ethereum` on MacOS
  - `/home/you/.local/share/parity` on Linux/Unix
- Keys are now stored in chain-specific directories . On first run of 1.5, all keys will be moved into the key's directory of the chain you run. You'll need to move the wallet files between directories manually if you wish to split them between testnet/mainnet.
- `--db-path` option now controls the path just for the databases, not for keys (`--keys-path`) or dapps (`--dapps-path`).

Basics:

- Version tracking, consensus-protection, hypervised auto-updating:
  - Parity will ensure syncing is paused if its version cannot support an upcoming hard-fork (disable with `--no-consensus`).
  - Parity will automatically download the latest version and may be updated through Parity Wallet (disable with `--no-download`)
  - Parity can automatically update and seamlessly restart to later versions in the same release track (enable with `--auto-update=all` or `--auto-update=critical`).
  - Parity hypervisor will automatically run the latest version (disable with `--force-direct`).
- Fat database; to enable, sync the chain with the option `--fat-db`.
  - Accounts and storage entries can be enumerated.
  - Chain state can be exported to JSON for analysis with `parity export state`.
- CLI and config options renamed: all variants of `--signer` are renamed to `--ui`.
- Log files are appended by default rather than truncated (useful for daemon deployments).

Parity Wallet:

- Multisig wallet support: "New Wallet" button in the "Accounts" section allows you to create a new multisig wallet or import an existing one.
- Solidity compiler: "Develop Contract" button in the "Contracts" section allows you to write, edit, compile and deploy contracts.
- SMS & e-mail verification: Accounts can now be certified as verified using Parity's SMS and e-Mail verification/registration oracle.
- Badge/certification integration: The `BadgeReg` contract can be used to deploy additional certifications.
- Local transaction propagation tracking: "TxQueue Viewer" in the "Applications" section allows you to track and resubmit previously sent transactions.
- Contract executions can now have gas and gas-price configured.
- Signer can now alter the gas and gas-price of transactions at password-entry.
- The deprecated Chrome "Signer" extension is now incompatible.

[Proof of Authority](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Proof-of-Authority-Chains):

- Authority Round consensus engine: `engine: authorityRound {...}`; this is a high-performance Proof-of-Authority consensus engine. It is not BFT under normal circumstances (however the `--force-sealing` flag can be used to ensure consensus even with Byzantine nodes).
- Tendermint Engine: `engine: tendermint {...}`; this is an experimental Proof-of-Authority consensus engine. BFT up to one third of the authorities and falling back to delayed finalization chain ordering (50% fault tolerant).
- Generic seal JSON spec includes engine-specific types (`seal: { generic: { rlp: "0x..." } }` becomes `seal: { authority_round { step: 0, signature: "0x..." } }`.
- To set a node as authority either `--engine-signer ADDRESS` should be used with `--password` or `parity_setEngineSigner(address, password)` RPC should be called. Unlocking the account permanently or using `--author` is now unnecessary.
- Set of authorities can now be specified using a [list or a contract](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/Consensus-Engines#validator-engines).

Chains:

- Dev chain: `--chain=dev`; instant seal engine (no mining needed). Great for development work.
- Ropsten chain (`--chain=ropsten` or `--chain=testnet`) configures for Ropsten, the new test net.
- Morden chain (`--chain=morden`) changed to "Classic" rules and stays as the Ethereum Classic test net.

RPCs/APIs:

- All JSON-RPC interfaces have strict JSON deserialization - no extra fields are allowed.
- `eth_sign` RPC now hashes given data instead of getting the hash.
- `signer_confirmRequestWithToken`: additional RPC for signing transactions with a rotating token, alleviating the need for keeping an account password in memory.
- `eth_signTransaction` now conforms to the specification, `eth_submitTransaction` is introduced.
