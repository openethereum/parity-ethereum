## Parity [v1.7.0](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/releases/tag/v1.7.0) (2017-07-28)

Parity 1.7.0 is a major release introducing several important features:

- **Experimental [Light client](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/The-Parity-Light-Protocol-(PIP)) support**. Start Parity with `--light` to enable light mode. Please, note: The wallet UI integration for the light client is not included, yet.
- **Experimental web wallet**. A hosted version of Parity that keeps the keys and signs transactions using your browser storage. Try it at https://wallet.parity.io or run your own with `--public-node`.
- **WASM contract support**. Private networks can run contracts compiled into WASM bytecode. _More information and documentation to follow_.
- **DApps and RPC server merge**. DApp and RPC are now available through a single API endpoint. DApp server related settings are deprecated.
- **Export accounts from the wallet**. Backing up your keys can now simply be managed through the wallet interface.
- **PoA/Kovan validator set contract**. The PoA network validator-set management via smart contract is now supported by warp and, in the near future, light sync.
- **PubSub API**. https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/JSONRPC-Parity-Pub-Sub-module
- **Signer apps for IOS and Android**.
