## Parity-Ethereum [v2.1.1](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.1.1) (2018-10-12)

Parity-Ethereum 2.1.2-beta is a release that introduces **Constantinople** to the Ethereum client. Upgrading is strongly recommended.

![europe-1803495_1280](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15729797/46785767-15f1e280-cd33-11e8-862a-458edfd73ecf.png)

The following hardforks are supported by this release:

- Ropsten testnet block `4_230_000` on October 14, 2018 (Constantinople)
- POA core mainnet block `5_329_160` on October 22, 2018 (CORE HF 2)
- Kovan testnet block `9_200_000` on October 25, 2018 (Constantinople, KIP-{4,6})

Running one of these networks, an upgrade to 2.0.7 or 2.1.2 is mandatory. More details can be found in Changelog below.

Please note, the following deprecations in our distribution of binaries:

- `arm*` targets are no longer served by parity, please consider (cross-)compiling from source yourself.
- `i*86` targets are no longer served by parity, please consider upgrading your operating system.

## Parity-Ethereum [v2.1.1](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.1.1) (2018-09-20)

Parity-Ethereum 2.1.1-beta is a release that does not improve performance and stability; no changes were made.

The full list of included changes:

- Backports for 2.1.1 beta ([#9599](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9599))
  - Parity: bump version to 2.1.1 beta
  - Ci: fix regex roll_eyes
  - Docs(rpc): annotate tag with the provided message

## Parity-Ethereum [v2.1.0](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.1.0) (2018-09-19)

Parity-Ethereum 2.1.0-beta is released! Look at this!

Important notices:

- This release moves the 2.1 track of Parity-Ethereum to beta.
- This release contains a low-severity issue with the web-sockets ports. [#9545](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9545)
- This release resolves a potential network fragmentation issue. [#9526](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9526)
- With this release, all versions of Parity Ethereum 1.x prior to 2.0 reached end of life.
- Users are urged to upgrade to 2.0.5-stable or 2.1.0-beta.

Further changes worth highlighting:

- Generalized `blockReward` and `difficultyBombDelays` config ([#9480](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9480)): This removes `eip649*` parameters from chain specs and allows `blockReward` to accept `multi`. Please review your chain-specs!
- Implement EIP234 `block_hash` for `eth_getLogs` ([#9256](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9256)): If `block_hash` and `from_block`/`to_block` present, return error. This also changes `eth_getLogs` to return error if any of `block_hash`/`from_block`/`to_block` cannot be found.
- The default `gas_floor_target` was increased to `8_000_000`, the default `gas_cap` to `10_000_000`.
- Light clients provide the actual account for `eth_coinbase` RPC ([#9383](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9383)). Note, this behavior is different from the full client where we return the `0x0` address if no accounts are found!
- Light servers give free credits for reserved peers ([#9448](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9448)): When connecting to a reserved peers in light client, assign free credits to them. This fixes the scenario where a home server is running a full node, and another light client connects to the full node as a reserved peer.
- Multi-threaded snapshot creation ([#9239](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9239)): to speed up the generation of snapshots on disk, this can be parallelized now. By default N/2 CPU cores are being used. Use `--snapshot-threads` flag to customize the number of threads.
- Remove all dapp permissions related settings ([#9120](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9120)). This completely removes dapp permission settings from `AccountProvider` and JSON-RPC: In JSON-RPC, all available accounts are returned, regardless of the origin; previously we return accounts based on dapps policy. It's not possible to set a "default account" (as for dapps) any more; this is now always the first account in the available account list.
- Remove unused `--tx_queue_gas` parameter ([#9153](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9153)). Please use `parity --help` to learn about available transaction queue strategies.

  - This PR is fixing deadlock for [#8918](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/8918)
  - It avoids some recursive calls on light_sync by making state check optional for Informant.
  - The current behavior is to display the information when informant checks if block is major version.
  - This change a bit the informant behavior, but not on most cases.
  - To remember where and how this kind of deadlock are likely to happen (not seen with Parkinglot deadlock detection because it uses std condvar), I am adding a description of the deadlock.
  - Also, for the reviewers there may be better solution than modifying the informant.

When specified, it will execute the code directly and overrides any `blockRewardContractAddress` config. Having this `blockRewardContractCode` config allows chains to deploy hard fork by simply replacing the current config value, without the need from us to support any `multi` block reward scheme.

- Propagate transactions for next 4 blocks. ([#9265](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9265))
  - Closes [#9255](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/issues/9255)
  - This PR also removes the limit of max 64 transactions per packet, currently we only attempt to prevent the packet size to go over 8MB. This will only be the case for super-large transactions or high-block-gas-limit chains. Patching this is important only for chains that have blocks that can fit more than 4k transactions (over 86M block gas limit) For mainnet, we should actually see a tiny bit faster propagation since instead of computing 4k pending set, we only need `4 * 8M / 21k = 1523` transactions. Running some tests on `dekompile` node right now, to check how it performs in the wild.

  - Restore some of the changes

- Multiple improvements to discovery ping handling ([#8771](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/8771))
  - Discovery: Only add nodes to routing table after receiving pong.
    - Previously the discovery algorithm would add nodes to the routing table before confirming that the endpoint is participating in the protocol. This now tracks in-flight pings and adds to the routing table only after receiving a response.
  - Discovery: Refactor packet creation into its own function.
    - This function is useful inside unit tests.
  - Discovery: Additional testing for new add_node behavior.
  - Discovery: Track expiration of pings to non-yet-in-bucket nodes.
    - Now that we may ping nodes before adding to a k-bucket, the timeout tracking must be separate from BucketEntry.
  - Discovery: Verify echo hash on pong packets.
    - Stores packet hash with in-flight requests and matches with pong response.
  - Discovery: Track timeouts on FIND_NODE requests.
  - Discovery: Retry failed pings with exponential backoff.
    - Udp packets may get dropped, so instead of immediately booting nodes that fail to respond to a ping, retry 4 times with exponential backoff.
  - !fixup Use slice instead of Vec for request_backoff.
- Add separate database directory for light client ([#8927](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/8927)) ([#9064](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/9064))
  - Add seperate default DB path for light client ([#8927](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/pull/8927))
